# Automating University Security System Using Face Recognition and ALPR

## Overview üìñ

This project is an Automated Security System designed to enhance security by integrating face recognition and automatic license plate recognition (ALPR). The system captures and processes images to identify authorized individuals and vehicles, making it ideal for environments such as universities.

## Features ‚ú®

- Face Recognition: Utilizes the face_recognition library for identifying authorized personnel.
- License Plate Recognition: Implements YOLOv8 for object detection and Tesseract OCR for extracting license plate information.
- GUI Interface: Built using Tkinter for easy interaction and monitoring.
- CRUD: Driver and Vehicle management system

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tkinter/ttlbootstrap
- face_recognition library
- YOLOv8
- Tesserac_OCR
